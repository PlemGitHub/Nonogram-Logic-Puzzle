# Nonogram-Logic-Puzzle

New to me:
- MD5 hash-function to determine unique puzzle in file;
- Calculation separated from visual classes;
- Enum use;
- Work with throwing exception.
- Greater use of JOptionPane parameters;
- JLayeredPane to create glass pane above game field;
- Screenshot of game field, combined from two different JPanels.
